## Weather Dashboard

### Question A: 
Using data from Weather Forecast-Data.gov.sg, design a simple Angular application which will display the daily temperature, humidity trend chart for the last 30 days.  You should also display the temperature and humidity data in tabular form, date input field for users to change the start date, and a button to refresh the data from the source based on the userâ€™s input. 
1.	Apply for a free public stackblitz account to create the angular app. 
2.	Submit the link to your angular app. 
Hint: Use Service to get data, ag-grid to display tabular data, highchart or plotly to plot chart. Bootstrap for styling
Will be a bonus if you can add automated test cases to your code.

Run App
```
ng serve
```

Run Test
```
ng test
```

### Question B (Open Ended Question): 
Routing in Angular is responsible is responsible for interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to navigate to a client-generated view. The router is bound to links on a page to tell Angular to navigate the application view when a user clicks on it.
If you somehow are being restricted and forbidden to use Angular Routing in your Web UI development, what are the different ways or alternate approach you will consider to overcome this constraint. Please describe to us the approach/method you will adopt and implement (can be in the form of pseudo code, or description in words) and explain to us the reason why you choose this method and why you think it is effective.
